===

This repo is a test / learning experience / showcase for a React app while also serving as a platform for testing. Here is some of the things I have learned / practiced while building this repo:

* Practice using terminal commands to `cd` to this directory, `ls` the files or launch the dir in VS Code via `code .`
* Practice using `git` commands to `init`, `status`, `push`, `pull`, `branch` & `checkout` instead of GitHub Desktop
* Practice using `Homebrew` on MacOS to install `composer`
* Practice building a new `laravel` php app with a `react` front-end using `composer`
* Practice doing `unit testing`
